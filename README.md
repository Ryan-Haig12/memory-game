# Memory-Game
This project is an implementation of the classic memory card game. The idea is there are 16 cards on the screen and each card is part of a pair. Match 2 cards and they will remain on the screen. The goal is to find all 8 pairs in as little time and clicks as possible. 

# Playing the game
The game is available at https://memory-game-haig.herokuapp.com/.

# Powered by Giphy
The images on the cards are provided by a GET request to the Giphy API with the search term the user enters into the search bar. The API information can be found at https://developers.giphy.com/
